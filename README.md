# DISTANCE CALCULATOR

## Description
This Java program calculates the average miles per hour and miles per gallon based on user input. It takes the distance traveled in miles, the time traveled in hours, and the gallons of petrol used during the journey. 
The program then computes and displays the average speed (in miles per hour) and the fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon).

## Features
- **Scanner class:** The program uses the Scanner class to take user input.
- **distanceCalculator class:** It defines the class `distanceCalculator`, which contains the main method.
- **Main method:** This is the entry point of the program.
- **Scanner object:** A Scanner object is created to capture user inputs.
- **Calculations:** The program calculates miles per hour (`milesPerHour`) and miles per gallon (`milesPerGallon`) using simple arithmetic operations.
- **Closing scanner:** The Scanner object is closed after all inputs are received to prevent resource leaks.
- **Output:** The calculated values are printed to the console.

## Installation
No specific installation is required. Just ensure you have a Java runtime environment to execute the program.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. When prompted, input the distance traveled in miles.
3. Next, input the time traveled in hours.
4. Finally, input the gallons of petrol used.
5. The program will display the average miles per hour and miles per gallon based on the inputs provided.

## Note
Ensure that valid numerical inputs are provided to avoid any runtime errors.
